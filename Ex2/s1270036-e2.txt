The explanations1270036 Yuki TomeA software project consists of several milestones.So, the relationship between software project and milestones is 1 to many.Each milestone has the attributes of the deadline date/time and the short name.A milestone includes a number of tasks.So, the relationship between a milestone and tasks is 1 to many.A project team works on the project.So, the relationship between software project and project team is 1 to 1.A team includes many engineers (at least one).A team leader is only one in the project.So, the relationship between the team leader and project team is 1 to 1,the relationship between engineers and Project team is 1 to 0 or many because there is absolutely one team leader on the project team, so the engineer is more than 0.A team leader and engineers (more than 0) are assigned to task and develop implementation.So, the relationship (Ågbe associated toÅh and ÅgdevelopÅh) between the team leader and engineer and tasks is 1 to many, 0 or many to many.Tasks have the attributes of IDs, descriptions and date/time deadline.The team leader assigns tasks and marks the tasks as completed.An implementation solves task.There could be no bugs or many bugs associated with an implementation.So, the relationship between implementation and bugs is 1 to 0 or many.
